                    Industrial projects are often marked by significant inherent 
                    <b>complexity</b> and <b>variability</b>. <br> <br> - The first aspect is 
                    represented by the numerous activities that comprise a project 
                    and the complex precedence relationships to which the activities 
                    must adhere. <br> <br> - The second point is the duration of individual 
                    activities, which is never deterministic but characterized by 
                    variability. <br><br> For these reasons studying the KPIs of an 
                    activity project is difficult.

                    This thesis aims to provide a comprehensive methodology for 
                    studying a <b>generic activity project</b>  in presence of 
                    variability. In particular, the <b>completion time </b> value 
                    at risk <b>(VAR)</b>  will be investigated. <br><br> The 
                    activity project is modeled as a continuous-time Markov chain, 
                    where each activity follows a phase-type distribution. The 
                    proposed methodology enables the analyticla estimation of the 
                    <b> distribution of project duration </b> through the solution 
                    of an ordinary differential equations system. <br><br> Employing 
                    a <b>newly developed Python tool</b>, a fast assessment of the 
                    network completion time VAR is provided. This enables planners 
                    for measuring risk and assessing robust methodology to face uncertainty.

                        the project. A directed graph with precedence relations with activity 
                        on arc (AoA) representation is used as a network model. In this type of 
                        graph, the dependencies or precedence relations among activities are 
                        represented by directed edges connecting the nodes.

                        while the other three activities remain pending.

                        implies that, if the precedence state has more than one activity running in

                    <p class="p_tesi">Time is incorporated into the analysis using a continuous time Markov chain model. <br> 
                        A Markov process, also known as a Markov chain, is a mathematical model used to
                        describe the behaviour of a stochastic system over time. When describing a Markov 
                        process, a collection of interlinked stochastic processes is considered, that 
                        together model the behaviour of the entire system over time. The system moves from 
                        one state to another according to a set of transitions that can be described by 
                        continuous-time probabilities distributions that regulate the evolution of the system. <br>
                        Continuous-time Markov chain processes are governed by two fundamental properties 
                        that determine their dynamics and future evolution:
                    </p>
          
                    <ul class="tesi_ul">
                        <li>All activity durations are mutually independent positive random variables. </li>
                        <li>All activity durations distributions are characterized by the memoryless property.</li>
                    </ul>
        
                    <p class="p_tesi">
                        For a general activity network, under the assumption that the activity duration
                        satisfies the properties above, the execution of the activity network can be modelled
                        through a continuous time Markov chain. However, the Markov chain model is applicable 
                        only if the model assumptions are met. This is usually achieved through exponential 
                        distributions that fit the model requirements but are limited in the representation 
                        of general activity duration distributions for real industrial processes. <br>
        
                        To cope with generally distributed activity duration, phase-type distributions are 
                        introduced. <br> A phase-type distribution is a probability distribution constructed 
                        by a convolution or mixture of exponential distributions. It results from a system 
                        of one or more interrelated Poisson processes occurring in sequence, or phases. 
                        The sequence in which each of the phases occurs may itself be a stochastic process. 
                        The distributions of the phase-type model represent a random variable describing the
                        time until absorption of a Markov process with one absorbing state. Each of the 
                        states of the Markov process represents one of the phases. This is the key intuition
                        that is used to assess activity network makespan value at risk. <br> This allows 
                        for the handling and modelling of generic probability distribution functions, that 
                        present asymmetric shapes and multimodality.  Figure 4 shows an example of empirical data fitting, 
                        using phase-type distributions.

                    <p class="p_tesi">From the analysis carried out, the computation of the infinitesimal generator matrix 
                        (F3) resulted to be the slowest part of the process. Here the algorithm takes in the 
                        worst case 33 [min] to compute the infinitesimal generator matrix starting from a state 
                        space with 30.000 as dimensions. F3 shows quadratic behaviour. The state computation 
                        function (F1) takes 40 [s] in the worst case which is quite less if compared to F3. 
                        Also, the state computation function is characterized by a quadratic behaviour. Analysis 
                        of Function 4 for the solution of the exponential matrix with expv, shows promising 
                        results as the behaviour seems linear and the worst-case matrix size takes just 40 
                        seconds to obtain a result.
